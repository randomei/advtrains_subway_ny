# AdvTrains Train Pack: New York City Subway

This mod provides a control car and intermediate cars for a New York City-like
subway train that could fit in just about any American rapid transit type
setting.

This mod was originally made by MBB. It is not without its problems. The door
animation is broken. The UV unwrapping and geometry have a few warped spots.
